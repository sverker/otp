 * Description:	Process signal queue implementation.
 *
 *              Currently the following signals are handled:
 *              - Messages
 *              - Exit
 *              - Monitor
 *              - Demonitor
 *              - Monitor down
 *              - Persistent monitor message
 *              - Link
 *              - Unlink
 *              - Group leader
 *              - Is process alive
 *              - Trace change
 *
 *              The signal queue consists of three parts:
 *              - Outer queue (sig_inq field in process struct)
 *              - Middle queue (sig_qs field in process struct)
 *              - Inner queue (sig_qs field in process struct)
 *
 *              Incoming signals are placed in the outer queue
 *              by other processes, ports, or by the runtime system
 *              itself. This queue is protected by the msgq process
 *              lock and may be accessed by any other entity. While
 *              a signal is located in the outer queue, it is still
 *              in transit between sender and receiver.
 *
 *              The middle and the inner queues are private to the
 *              receiving process and can only be accessed while
 *              holding the main process lock. The signal changes
 *              from being in transit to being received while in
 *              the middle queue. Non-message signals are handled
 *              immediately upon reception while message signals
 *              are moved into the inner queue.
 *
 *              In the outer and middle queues both message signals
 *              and non-message signals are mixed. Signals in these
 *              queues are referenced using two single linked lists.
 *              One single linked list that go through all signals
 *              in the queue and another single linked list that
 *              goes through only non-message signals. The list
 *              through the non-message signals is used for fast
 *              access to these signals in the middle queue, since
 *              these should be handled immediately upon reception.
 *
 *              The inner queue consists only of one single linked
 *              list through the message signals. A receive
 *              expression can only operate on messages once they
 *              have entered the inner queue.
